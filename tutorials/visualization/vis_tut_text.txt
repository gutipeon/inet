1. Showing Boston downtown
	- Goals:
		- Showing a map of a real city
	- Model:
		- network:
			- IMG: VisualizationNetworkA
			- VisualizationNetworkA
				- adding coordinateSystem
				- adding visualizer
		- parameters:
			- IMG: [Config Visualization01]
			- coordinate system:
				- setting the longitude, latitude and altitude coordinate of the playground origin
				- setting the orientation of the playground
			- scene visualizer:
				- setting our mapfile
				- setting the playground shading, color and opacity
				- setting the axis length
	- Results:
		- showing the map and the axis in 3d
		- IMG: contains the axis' neighborhood, and the park
		- can zoom in/out, rotate, move
		- change camera mode, that means you can change the mouse buttons' and wheel's action
		- in 2d you can see only the coordinateSystem and the visualizer submodule


2. Adding static 3D objects to the scene	(under construction, dependency!!!)
	- Goals:
		- adding kml file because it's looking good
	- Model:
		- network:
			- 
	- Results:
		- 


3. Displaying communiation/interference range
	- Goals:
		- Showing communication range of the peds and ap &
		- Showing interference range of the pads and ap, becausewe want to know that in what areas they can communicate
	- Model:
		- network:
			- VisualizationNetworkB
			- adding pedestrians and one ap to the appropriate position
			- adding networkConfigurator to configurate network nodes
			- adding radioMedium that's simulating the media
		- parameters:
			- set wlan transmitter power, that define the communication range
			- set displayCommunicationRange true, to display communication range
			- set displayInterferenceRange true, to display interference range
	- Results:
		- each node has two circles:
			- we can see communication range (small one)
			- we can see interference range (big one). Must zoom out to see
			- we can see these in 2d mode too


4. Using 3D models for network nodes
	- Goals:
		- changing nodes to 3d models because it's swag, we have really good boxman model to change the pedestrians' cellphone
	- Model:
		- parameters:
			- we use the osgModel parameter to change the pedestrians' displaying
			- after the equal sign we have to set our model.
			- with the ".(0.1).scale" we can change the model size. Smaller number means smaller model 
	- Results:
		- GIF: the walking boxmen
		- we can see walking boxmen in the park
		- no change in 2d


5. Displaying recent movement
	- Goals:
		- Displaying the pedestrians' movement, because they're walking in the park during the call
	- Model:
		- parameters:
			- adding mobility parameters:
				- mobilityType sets the movement of the network nodes. The access point's type is StationaryMobility, the pedestrians' type is MassMobility
				- the or initialX, initialY and initialZ show the pedestrians' starting position
				- with the constraintArea parameters we can set borders for the pedestrians. They can move only within these boundaries
				- setting their movement direction with the changeAngleBy, and how often they change that with the changeInterval parameter
				- we can set their speed
			- adding visualizer parameters
				- we can visualize the nodes velocity, orientation and we can display their movement trail with these settings
	- Results:
		- The ap is on its place
		- In 3d the peds are moving in random directon, leaving a movement trail behind
		- In 2d happens the same + we can see a velocity vector at each pedestrian

6. Showing IP addresses
	- Goals:
		- Showing the nodes' IP address because of a troubleshooting reason for example
	- Model:
		- parameters:
			- set which node's which interface is considered
			- adding interface table visualizer parameters:
				- the nodeFilter parameter shows which nodes are considered. By default it's "no nodes"
				- the interfaceFilter parameter shows which interfaces are considered for each nodes. By default "all interfaces" considered.
	- Results:
		- on a yellow background we can see the pedestrians' IP addresses (we can change the background and the font color???)
		- IMG: a pedestrian with its IP address
		- GIF: the access point and the moving pedestrians with their IP addresses


7. Showing wifi association - DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY YET!!!
	- Goals:
		- Displaying the pedestrians to which access point connect. We will see an SSID probably, or any unequivocal data from the access point
		- Displaying the access point's ssid
	- Model:
		- parameters:
			- turn off the interfaceTableVisualizer, because of looking reasons
			- we set the ssid parameter's "location" to the "infoVisualizer.modules". That will be displaying the access point's ssid
			- we can change the text color, and the text background color, to looks these information clearly
	- Results:
		- Above the nodes we can see the appropriate information
		- IMG: include the nodes
		- GIF: the "" change to "SSID" above a node/the nodes


8. Displaying transmissions & receptions
	- Goals:
		- The network works properly, the peds associated to access point, so we create some communication between the peds through the access point
		- We want to know who transmits and who receives the signal at any moment
	- Model:
		- parameters:
			- setting the application's parameters. They're necessary to keep the simulation realistic:
				- simulate a voice stream --> basic udp app
				- set the destination addresses to the other pedestrian, and set the source and destination port at each pedestrian
				- we can set the message length
				- set the interval of the message sending
				- add a name to the packets, that identifies the packets
			- setting the visualization's parameters:
				- these belong to the medium, so we use mediumVisualizer parameters
				- displayTransmissions/displayReceptions to display who transmits and receives the signals
				- we assign images to the transmission/reception roles
	- Results:
		- we can see the assigned images above the network nodes at appropriate moment
		- GIF: include the nodes for a few seconds


9. Showing propagating signals
	- Goals:
		- We can see the transmitter&receiver, but we want to see the propagated signals too
	- Model:
		- parameters:
			- setting medium visualizer parameters:
				- enable signal displaying
				- we can set the signal propagation interval (by default it doesn't update)
				- set the signal shape both. There are three modes: ring, sphere, both. ring is a 2d ring on the ground, sphere is a 3d propagation mode, both means displaying both of them (by default it's ring)
				-3 GIF: include the three signal shapes?
	- Results:
		- at every propagation interval the signal is spreading on the ground as a ring and in the air as a sphere
		- the signal has a beginning and an ending point (not a point exatly.. a ring maybe)
		- we can see the signal's type on the ground, and it's going with the signals end
		- between the signal beginning and ending we can see the transmissions and receptions mark above the nodes
		- GIF: include the lines above this


10. Showing active physical links
	- Goals:
		- Displaying the active physical links between the network nodes
	- Model:
		- with the physical link visualizer packet name filter parameter we can filtering which packets are considered to determine active pyhisical links
		- by the way we can change the line widht, line color, line style and fading mode too
	- Results:
		- it displays an arrow for each active link in the network
		- the arrow points from the source towards the destination. If a link is used in both directions then there are arrowheads on both ends of the arrow
		- each arrow fades out over time until the link becomes inactive unless it is reinforced by another packet.
		- the arrow automatically follows the movement of mobile nodes.


11. Showing active data links
	- Goals:
		- Showing the active data links between the pedestrians and the access point
	- Model:
		- parameter:
			- turn off the physical link visualizer, so we can follow the data links without any disturbing factors
			- with the data link visualizer packet name filter parameter we can filtering which packets are considered to determine active links
	- Results:
		- similar the results of showing active physical links
		- different is the data link not equal physical link, so it's displaying rarely
